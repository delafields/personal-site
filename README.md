## TODOs
Homepage
* Remove job title
* (LAST) stripes should be responsive and centered
  * do I even keep these? is it too plain without them? 
  * could I replace them with something? stripes of red blue yellow?
* Rename "experience" to something like professional experience

Experience page
  * Add title to "experience" page, like irl/code projects
  * Rename "My timeline"
  * Try moving timeline box up higher

Projects
* try making projects filterable (keep the filter options MINIMAL)
    * Code: data, web, mobile, cli
    * IRL: wood, art?, this is probably too diverse to be able to put good filters on it

Mobile
* center & bold name, center IRL projects below it
* experience, twitter, github should be bottom center
* try to figure out what's making pages > vh on mobile

Desktop
* IRL/code projects should display > 1 post per column

Tunes
* figure this shit out and make it work god damnit
